Goal: build a coordinate system and set of DEMs for working around Shackleton ridge.

Starting from 10m LOLA data:
    - Convert to OpenEXR 32-bit float format: dem.exr
        Scaled -10km .. +10km elevation range to 0-1, so GIMP actually shows topography.
    - Crop to 8192x8192 centered on south pole: dem_10m_8192x8192_southpole.exr
        Crop via "Canvas Size" lets you do numeric centered crops easily.
        GIMP saves a large uncompressed EXR file.
    Apply radius 3 circular median blur

shackridge:
    == basemap cropped down to 5120x5120 50km region
    - Crop to 5120x5120 area centered on ridge: dem_shackridge_10m_5120x5120.exr
        Cropped at -1096, -2596 from 8192x8192 image, so the south pole should sit at
            Cropped to +3000, +2500 from the basemap (i.e., shackridge top left is at (-30km, -25km) in lunar pole projection)
        - Scaled to 256x256 200m DEM: dem_shackridge_200m_256x256.exr
    - Convert to RGBA and generate Generic -> Normal Map
        - Scale by 5000 looks about right, not quite saturating
