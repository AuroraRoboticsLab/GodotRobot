# Tool Attachments

The current tool attachments are:
* [Bucket](bucket/) (capable of excavating terrain), 
* [Forks](fork/) (designed to work with the [Madsen cinderblock](../../../objects/madsen_cinderblock/), and
* [Sawblade](sawblade/).

All tools inherit from the BaseTool node which contains:
* A CenterOfMass marker, and 
* A [ConnectorComponent](../../../components/connector_component/connector_component.tscn)
